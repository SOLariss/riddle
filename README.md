check for the solution of 12 coins riddle
My solution and check for a popula riddle:

There are 12 gold coins. One of the coins is fake. It is known that a fake coin weighs either
slightly less or slightly more than a real coin. Using a balance scale, how can you find the fake coin,
and determine if it weighs less or more than a real coin, in only three weighings?
